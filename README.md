Jam theme: Waves.

PingSong is a game of ping pong with a difference.
Hitting a visualiser bar with the ball causes the ball to slow down or speed up depending on the size of the bar.
The visualiser in the center of the screen reacts to game audio as well as the soundtrack.
The visualiser also responds to microphone input. Try shouting at the ball as it reaches the center!
The paddles oscillate between the left and right walls and the direction of movement can be swapped by pressing space
or left mouse click.
